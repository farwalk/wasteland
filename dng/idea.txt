The idea is that choices the player can make during the adventure can
lead them down different paths.  Some of these things are
mutually exclusive.

So if you rescue the princess you can ransom her to the enemy kingdom
and that will lead you down the Traitor's Path which may be a long
or short series of adventures.

Or you could romance the princess and that would take you down the
Romance Path
